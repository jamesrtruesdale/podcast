# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project: lambdapodcast

## Overview

Self-hosted podcast generator that turns curated MP3 files into an Apple Podcasts-compatible feed.

**Architecture:**
- MP3s + cover art hosted on Dropbox
- RSS feed generated by Python script
- Feed hosted on GitHub Pages (unlisted, obscure URL)
- Subscribable via Apple Podcasts

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x (no external dependencies, stdlib only)
- YAML for configuration
- GitHub Pages for RSS hosting
- Dropbox for media hosting

## Build & Run

```bash
# Generate the RSS feed
python generate_feed.py

# Output: docs/feed.xml (GitHub Pages serves from /docs)

# Validate feed (optional)
python -c "import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET; ET.parse('docs/feed.xml'); print('Valid XML')"
```

## Architecture

```
lambdapodcast/
├── config.yaml          # Podcast metadata (title, author, cover art URL)
├── episodes.yaml        # Episode list (title, description, mp3 URL, date)
├── generate_feed.py     # RSS generator script
├── docs/
│   ├── feed.xml         # Generated RSS feed (GitHub Pages serves this)
│   └── robots.txt       # Block search engine indexing
└── README.md
```

## Workflow

1. Upload MP3 to Dropbox, get share link, change `?dl=0` to `?dl=1`
2. Add episode to `episodes.yaml`
3. Run `python generate_feed.py`
4. Commit and push to GitHub
5. Apple Podcasts auto-updates within 24 hours

## Issue Tracking

See @AGENTS.md for beads workflow commands.
